## Open Source Libraries

This project utilizes the following open source libraries:

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - A modern programming language for Android development.
- [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - A set of libraries to help with Android development.
- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - A dependency injection library for Android.
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?hl=tr) - Provides a simple way to manage background threads, making asynchronous programming easier and more efficient.
* [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - A reactive streams API in Kotlin used for managing data streams asynchronously.
- [Material Components](https://material.io/develop/android) - A library for implementing Material Design in Android apps.
* [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel#implement) - A design pattern used to separate concerns, making the application more modular, testable, and maintainable.
  * [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Manages Android lifecycle-aware components.
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  * [UseCases](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/domain-layer) - Located domain layer that sits between the UI layer and the data layer.
  * [Repository](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer) - Located in the data layer that contains application data and business logic.
- [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) - An HTTP client for Android and Java applications.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - A library for converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa.

## WebSocket Integration

SmartNest uses WebSockets to enable real-time communication between the app and the server. This allows for instant updates and notifications, enhancing the user experience. Key features of the WebSocket integration include:

- **Real-Time Updates**: Users receive immediate updates on their smart devices' status.
- **Efficient Communication**: WebSockets provide a persistent connection, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The app can respond to events from the server in real-time, improving responsiveness.

### How to Use WebSockets

1. Ensure that the WebSocket server is running and accessible.
2. Connect to the WebSocket server using the provided URL in the app.
3. Listen for messages and handle them appropriately in your application logic.

## Commit Practices

This project follows atomic commit practices and uses semantic commit messages. 

- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change. This makes it easier to understand the history of changes and to revert specific changes if necessary.
  
- **Semantic Commit Messages**: Commit messages should follow the format:
  - `type(scope): subject`
  - Examples of types include:
    - `feat`: A new feature
    - `fix`: A bug fix
    - `docs`: Documentation changes
    - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
    - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

This practice helps maintain a clear and organized commit history, making it easier for contributors to understand the project's evolution.
